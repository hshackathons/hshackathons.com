<!-- <p>When the first High School Hackers meetup was held at PennApps last year, it brought together hundreds of like-minded teenagers for the first time. Over the course a year, high school hackers made their mark, not only exhibiting hockey stick growth in their Facebook group, but also winning hackathons like MHacks. Today, weâ€™re bringing High School hacking to the next level with the introduction of High School Hackathons, a partnership with High School Hackers that will focus on teenage hackers. Currently, High School Hackathons will display high school hackathon events and college level hackathons that admit high schoolers.
